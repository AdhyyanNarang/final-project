# Decentailized Github!

Currently, all the open source code on GitHub is stored on their servers and managed by them. At any point in time, they could possibly alter the code, remove commits, make the code private, etc.

A decentralized version of GitHub would ensure that the data is not managed by GitHub, but rather decentralized on the blockchain. IPFS would be used to store the code. The Ethereum network would be used to update the code/make state changes.
